# üèôÔ∏è Winstone Multimodal Foundation Model (WinFM)

**Proof-of-Concept Evaluation and Backtest for Real Estate Investment**

---
This project presents a proof-of-concept (POC) validation of Winstone‚Äôs WinFM using comprehensive real estate transaction data from London (2010‚Äì2024), aggregated at the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level. We compare WinFM with other models including LLM, temporal models and traditional spatial-temporal models. WinFM achieves a technical breakthrough by unifying language understanding with spatial-temporal modeling in an efficient, scalable architecture‚Äîdelivering the first effective multimodal solution for real estate forecasting. 
## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/winstone
cd winstone
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use Python 3.8+ and install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn pyarrow
```

Alternatively, use a `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Evaluation & Backtest

Run the following command to compute model prediction metrics and investment backtest results:

```bash
python evaluate.py --results_dir results
```

This will output:

- **Prediction Metrics**: RMSE, SMAPE, MASE, R¬≤
- **Investment Backtest**: Total Return, CAGR, Success Rate
